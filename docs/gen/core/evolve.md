# Evolving AI Framework

## Overview

The RD-Agent framework implements an evolutionary approach to AI development, particularly for financial factor models. The system uses a combination of iterative evolution and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to continuously improve AI models through multiple iterations.

## Core Components

### 1. Evolving Framework Architecture

The evolution process is built on several key abstractions:

- **EvolvableSubjects**: Objects that can evolve over time (e.g., factor models, experiments)
- **EvolvingStrategy**: Defines how subjects evolve based on history, feedback, and knowledge
- **EvoStep**: Captures the state of evolution at each step
- **RAGStrategy**: Implements knowledge retrieval and generation

### 2. Evolution Agent (`EvoAgent`)

The `EvoAgent` class orchestrates the evolutionary process:

- Controls the maximum number of evolution loops
- Implements the multistep evolution strategy
- Integrates with evaluators to assess evolved subjects
- Manages the evolutionary trace (history of changes)

### 3. RAG-Enhanced Evolution (`RAGEvoAgent`)

`RAGEvoAgent` extends the basic evolution process with RAG capabilities:

- Retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge base
- Generates new knowledge based on evolution history
- Incorporates knowledge into the evolution strategy
- Maintains feedback loops to guide evolution

## Evolution Process Flow

The evolution process follows a structured pattern:

1. **Initialization**: Create an evolvable subject and configure the evolution strategy
2. **Multistep Evolution**: For each evolution step:
   - Retrieve relevant knowledge from the RAG system (optional)
   - Apply the evolution strategy to generate a new version of the subject
   - Evaluate the evolved subject
   - Record the evolution step
   - Check if the subject meets the completion criteria
3. **Knowledge Generation**: Optionally generate new knowledge for the knowledge base
4. **Termination**: End evolution when all tasks are completed or maximum loops reached

## RAG Integration

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach enhances the evolution process by:

### Knowledge Retrieval

During each evolution step, the RAG system:

1. Analyzes the current state of the evolvable subject
2. Examines the evolution history (trace)
3. Queries the knowledge base for relevant information
4. Returns queried knowledge to inform the evolution strategy

```python
queried_knowledge = self.rag.query(evo, self.evolving_trace)
```

### Knowledge Generation

The system can generate new knowledge by:

1. Analyzing the evolution trace and outcomes
2. Identifying successful patterns and strategies
3. Formulating new knowledge entries
4. Storing them in the knowledge base for future use

```python
if self.knowledge_self_gen and self.rag is not None:
    self.rag.generate_knowledge(self.evolving_trace)
```

### Knowledge Persistence

The framework supports:

- Loading existing knowledge bases from disk
- Saving updated knowledge for future sessions
- Version-specific knowledge base implementations

## Implementation: CoSTEER

CoSTEER (Component-based Strategy for Test-driven Evolution and Evaluation Refinement) is a concrete implementation of the evolving AI framework:

### CoSTEER Components

- **CoSTEERKnowledgeBase**: Stores domain-specific knowledge for financial factor development
- **CoSTEERRAGStrategy**: Implements RAG techniques specific to factor development
- **EvolvingItem**: Concrete implementation of EvolvableSubjects for experiments

### Evolution Process in CoSTEER

1. Initialize the knowledge base and RAG strategy
2. Create an evolvable item from the input experiment
3. Run multistep evolution with feedback
4. Post-process the result based on feedback
5. Update and save the knowledge base

### Multiple Strategy Versions

CoSTEER supports multiple versions of RAG strategies:

- **V1**: Basic implementation focusing on simple knowledge retrieval
- **V2**: Enhanced implementation with more sophisticated knowledge generation and component-based organization

## Benefits of the Evolving AI Approach

1. **Iterative Improvement**: Models evolve gradually rather than being created from scratch
2. **Knowledge Reuse**: Past experiences inform future development
3. **Feedback Integration**: Evaluation results guide the evolution process
4. **History-Aware**: The system considers the full evolution trace when making decisions
5. **Adaptability**: Evolution strategies can be customized for different domains
