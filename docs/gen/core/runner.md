# Runner Component

## Overview
The Runner is responsible for executing the development and evaluation phases of the RD workflow. It implements the logic for turning code into executable models and evaluating their performance.

## Key Responsibilities

### Development
The Runner's `develop()` method takes code implementation and executes it to produce experiments or factors:

```python
exp = runner.develop(code_implementation)
```

### Integration with RDLoop
Runners are integrated into the RD workflow through the RDLoop's `running()` method:

```python
def running(self, prev_out: dict[str, Any]):
    with logger.tag("execution"):
        # Runner executes the code from previous step
        exp = self.runner.develop(prev_out["coding"])
        # Process and validate results
    return exp
```

### Configuration
Runners can be configured with domain-specific settings to control:
- Execution environment
- Resource limits
- Logging behavior
- Output validation

### Error Handling
Runners should implement appropriate error handling and provide clear feedback when development fails. Common patterns include:

```python
try:
    result = self.execute(code)
    if result is None or not self.validate(result):
        return None
    return result
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Development failed: {e}")
    return None
```

## Extensions
The Runner component can be extended for different domains or execution environments:
- **FactorRunner**: Specialized for financial factor development
- **ModelRunner**: Focused on machine learning model development
- **SimulationRunner**: For systems requiring simulation environments
