# RD-Agent Local Setup

## LiteLLM Setup

### Pre-Requisites

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-latest
docker pull pytorch/pytorch:2.2.1-cuda12.1-cudnn8-runtime
```

We will configure the docker container to proxy to a qwen models, with OpenAI compatible mode:

#### OpenAI parameters

* base_url: specifies the endpoint or address of the model services in Model Studio.
* api_key: sk-44xxxxxxxxx, get it from https://bailian.console.alibabacloud.com/, then authorise which models can be used of the workspace, e.g., Qwen-Plus (Qwen-Turbo coding quality seems low), Text-Embedding-v3.
* models: qwen-turbo-latest/qwen-plus-latest/qwen-max-latest

When you use the OpenAI SDK or other OpenAI-compatible SDKs, set base_url to:

 
https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1

For example, chat completes is to:

 
POST https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions

```bash
curl --location 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $DASHSCOPE_API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "qwen-plus",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Who are you?"
        }
    ]
}'
```

Embedding call example is:

```bash
curl --location 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/embeddings' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $DASHSCOPE_API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "text-embedding-v3",
    "input": "The clothes are of good quality and look good, definitely worth the wait. I love them and will shop here again",
    "encoding_format": "float"
}'
```

Content: The user is working on generating new hypotheses for the factors in a data-driven research and development process. 
The factors are used in the following scenario:
Background of the scenario:
The factor is a characteristic or variable used in quant investment that can help explain the returns and risks of a portfolio or a single asset. Factors are used by investors to identify and exploit sources of excess returns, and they are central to many quantitative investment strategies.
Each number in the factor represents a physics value to an instrument on a day.
User will train a model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values of the previous days.
The factor is defined in the following parts:
1. Name: The name of the factor.
2. Description: The description of the factor.
3. Formulation: The formulation of the factor.
4. Variables: The variables or functions used in the formulation of the factor.
The factor might not provide all the parts of the information above since some might not be applicable.
Please specifically give all the hyperparameter in the factors like the window size, look back period, and so on. One factor should statically defines one output with a static source data. For example, last 10 days momentum and last 20 days momentum should be two different factors.
The source data you can use:

# How to read files.
For example, if you want to read `filename.h5`
```Python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_hdf("filename.h5", key="data")
``
NOTE: **key is always "data" for all hdf5 files **.

# Here is a short description about the data

# For different data, We have some basic knowledge for them

## Daily price and volume data
$open: open price of the stock on that day.
$close: close price of the stock on that day.

The interface you should follow to write the runnable code:
Your python code should follow the interface to better interact with the user's system.
Your python code should contain the following part: the import part, the function part, and the main part. You should write a main function name: "calculate_{function_name}" and call this function in "if __name__ == __main__" part. Don't write any try-except block in your python code. The user will catch the exception message and provide the feedback to you.
User will write your python code into a python file and execute the file directly with "python {your_file_name}.py". You should calculate the factor values and save the result into a HDF5(H5) file named "result.h5" in the same directory as your python file. The result file is a HDF5(H5) file containing a pandas dataframe. The index of the dataframe is the "datetime" and "instrument", and the single column name is the factor name,and the value is the factor value. The result file should be saved in the same directory as your python file.
The output of your code should be in the format:
Your output should be a pandas dataframe similar to the following example information:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
MultiIndex: 40914 entries, (Timestamp('2020-01-02 00:00:00'), 'SH600000') to (Timestamp('2021-12-31 00:00:00'), 'SZ300059')
Data columns (total 1 columns):
#   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------            --------------  -----  
0   your factor name  40914 non-null  float64
dtypes: float64(1)
memory usage: <ignore>
Notice: The non-null count is OK to be different to the total number of entries since some instruments may not have the factor value on some days.
One possible format of `result.h5` may be like following:
datetime    instrument
2020-01-02  SZ000001     -0.001796
            SZ000166      0.005780

The simulator user can use to test your factor:
The factors will be sent into Qlib to train a model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values of the previous days. 
Qlib is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform that aims to realize the potential, empower research, and create value using AI technologies in quantitative investment, from exploring ideas to implementing productions. Qlib supports diverse machine learning modeling paradigms. including supervised learning, market dynamics modeling, and RL.
User will use Qlib to automatically do the following things:
1. generate a new factor table based on the factor values.
2. train a model like LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM or simple PyTorch model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values.
3. build a portfolio based on the predicted return based on a strategy.
4. evaluate the portfolio's performance including the return, sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and so on.

The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you. Your task is to check whether a similar hypothesis has already been generated. 
If one exists and you agree with it, feel free to use it. If you disagree, please generate an improved version.

To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: 1. **Type of Factor and Financial Trends:**
  - Define the type of factor introduced.
  - Explain the financial trends or market behaviors indicated by this factor.
  - Omit unnecessary or redundant details.

2. **Simple and Effective Factors First:**
  - Start with factors that are simple and likely effective.
  - Concisely explain why these factors are expected to work.
  - Avoid complex or combined factors initially.

3. **Gradual Complexity Increase:**
  - Introduce more complex factors as more experimental results are gathered.
  - Discuss potential advantages and complexities.
  - Combine factors only after simpler ones are tested and validated.

4. **New Directions and Optimizations:**
  - If a new direction is needed, explain why based on financial principles, economic theories, or market behaviors.
  - Suggest only one new direction at a time for clarity.
  - If a previous hypothesis did not surpass SOTA but seems optimizable, you may continue in the same direction.
  - Highlight that factors surpassing SOTA are included in the library to avoid re-implementation.

5. **1-3 Factors per Generation:**
  - Ensure each generation produces 1-3 factors.
  - Balance simplicity and complexity to build a robust factor library..
**Important:** If the hypothesis_specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.

Please generate the output using the following format and specifications:
The output should follow JSON format. The schema is as follows:
{
"hypothesis": "The new hypothesis generated based on the information provided.",
"reason": "The reason why you generate this hypothesis. It should be comprehensive and logical. It should cover the other keys below and extend them.",
"concise_reason": "Two-line summary. First line focuses on a concise justification for the change. Second line generalizes a knowledge statement.",
"concise_observation": "One line summary. It focuses on the observation of the given scenario, data characteristics, or previous experiences (failures & succeses).",
"concise_justification": "One line summary. Justify the hypothesis based on theoretical principles or initial assumptions.",
"concise_knowledge": "One line summary. Transferable knowledge based on theoretical principles. Use conditional grammar. eg. "If...., ..; When..., .; and etc" Make sure that you state things clearly without ambiguity. Eg. avoid saying "previous hypothesis", because one wouldn't know what that is."

Role:user
Content: It is not the first round, the user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows (focus on the last one & the new hypothesis that it provides and reasoning to see if you agree):
No previous hypothesis and feedback available since it's the first round.


Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows. For those keys, in particular for knowledge, explain in the context of the specific scenario to build up domain knowledge in the specific field rather than general knowledge.

##### Hypothesis Response

```js
{
"hypothesis": "The new hypothesis is to introduce a simple moving average crossover factor for identifying trend reversals. Specifically, we will calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and generate a factor based on their crossovers.",
"reason": "This hypothesis is based on the well-known technical analysis principle that moving average crossovers can indicate trend reversals. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are commonly used indicators in financial markets. By calculating these moving averages and generating a factor based on their crossovers, we aim to capture significant changes in the trend direction. Previous experiments have shown mixed results with more complex factors, suggesting a simpler approach might be more effective.",
"concise_reason": "Moving averages indicate trend reversals; simpler factors often perform better.",
"concise_observation": "Previous complex factors had mixed results.",
"concise_justification": "Simpler technical indicators can reliably signal trend changes.",

The task is described in the following scenario:

Background of the scenario:
The factor is a characteristic or variable used in quant investment that can help explain the returns and risks of a portfolio or a single asset. Factors are used by investors to identify and exploit sources of excess returns, and they are central to many quantitative investment strategies.
Each number in the factor represents a physics value to an instrument on a day.
User will train a model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values of the previous days.
The factor is defined in the following parts:
1. Name: The name of the factor.
2. Description: The description of the factor.
3. Formulation: The formulation of the factor.
4. Variables: The variables or functions used in the formulation of the factor.
The factor might not provide all the parts of the information above since some might not be applicable.
Please specifically give all the hyperparameter in the factors like the window size, look back period, and so on. One factor should statically defines one output with a static source data. For example, last 10 days momentum and last 20 days momentum should be two different factors.

The interface you should follow to write the runnable code:
Your python code should follow the interface to better interact with the user's system.
Your python code should contain the following part: the import part, the function part, and the main part. You should write a main function name: "calculate_{function_name}" and call this function in "if __name__ == __main__" part. Don't write any try-except block in your python code. The user will catch the exception message and provide the feedback to you.
User will write your python code into a python file and execute the file directly with "python {your_file_name}.py". You should calculate the factor values and save the result into a HDF5(H5) file named "result.h5" in the same directory as your python file. The result file is a HDF5(H5) file containing a pandas dataframe. The index of the dataframe is the "datetime" and "instrument", and the single column name is the factor name,and the value is the factor value. The result file should be saved in the same directory as your python file.
The output of your code should be in the format:
Your output should be a pandas dataframe similar to the following example information:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
MultiIndex: 40914 entries, (Timestamp('2020-01-02 00:00:00'), 'SH600000') to (Timestamp('2021-12-31 00:00:00'), 'SZ300059')
Data columns (total 1 columns):
#   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------            --------------  -----  
0   your factor name  40914 non-null  float64
dtypes: float64(1)
memory usage: <ignore>
Notice: The non-null count is OK to be different to the total number of entries since some instruments may not have the factor value on some days.
One possible format of `result.h5` may be like following:

You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their factors, their results, and the SOTA result. 
Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous SOTA (State of the Art) results, and suggest improvements or new directions.

Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback that is suitable for the scenario:
  1. Logic Explanation:
      - If the previous hypothesis factor surpasses the SOTA, include this factor in the SOTA factor library.
      - New experiments will generate new factors, which will be combined with the factors in the SOTA library.
      - These combined factors will be backtested and compared against the current SOTA to continuously iterate.
  2. Development Directions:
      - New Direction:
          - Propose a new factor direction for exploration and development.
      - Optimization of Existing Direction:
          - If the previous experiment's factor replaced the SOTA, suggest further improvements to that factor.
          - Clearly specify the differences in name and improvements compared to the previous factor.
      - Continued Research:
          - If the previous experiment's factor did not replace the SOTA, suggest ways to optimize and develop factors in this direction.
  3. Final Goal:
      - The ultimate goal is to continuously accumulate factors that surpass each iteration to maintain the best SOTA.

  When judging the results:
  1. **Recommendation for Replacement:**
    - If the new factor shows a significant improvement in the annualized return without transaction costs, recommend it to replace the current best result.
    - If the annualized return and any other single metric are better than SOTA, recommend the replacement.
    - Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.

Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with SOTA:
  - If the new results significantly differ from the SOTA, consider exploring a new direction.
  - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.

Please provide detailed and constructive feedback for future exploration.

Role:user
Content: Target hypothesis: 
A factor based on the 10-day moving average of the volume-weighted price (VWAP) could provide predictive power for future returns.
Tasks and Factors:

  - VWAP_10_Day_MA: This factor calculates the 10-day moving average of the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). VWAP is computed as the sum of the product of price and volume for each day divided by the total volume over the same period. The 10-day moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations and captures medium-term trends influenced by trading volumes.
    - Factor Formulation: VWAP_{t} = \frac{\sum_{i=t-9}^{t} (P_i \times V_i)}{\sum_{i=t-9}^{t} V_i}, \quad VWAP\_10\_Day\_MA_{t} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=t-9}^{t} VWAP_i
    - Variables: {'VWAP_t': 'Volume-Weighted Average Price at time t, calculated as the sum of price multiplied by volume for each day divided by the total volume over the same period.', 'P_i': 'Price of the instrument on day i.', 'V_i': 'Volume of the instrument on day i.', 'VWAP_10_Day_MA_t': '10-day moving average of VWAP at time t, calculated as the average of VWAP values over the last 10 days.'}
    - Factor Implementation: True

Analyze the combined result in the context of its ability to:
1. Support or refute the hypothesis.
2. Show improvement or deterioration compared to the SOTA experiment.

Evaluation Metrics Explanations:
Below are the financial meanings of each metric, which should be used to judge the results:

- 1day.excess_return_without_cost.max_drawdown: Measures the maximum loss from a peak to a trough without considering transaction costs. (the smaller the better)
- 1day.excess_return_without_cost.information_ratio: Evaluates the excess return per unit of risk without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
- 1day.excess_return_without_cost.annualized_return: Annualized return without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
- IC: Measures the correlation between predicted returns (\hat{y}) and actual returns (y), using Pearson correlation. (the bigger the better)

When judging the results:
  1. **Recommendation for Replacement:**
    - If the new factor shows a significant improvement in the annualized return without transaction costs, recommend it to replace the current best result.
    - If the annualized return and any other single metric are better than SOTA, recommend the replacement.
    - Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.

Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with SOTA:
  - If the new results significantly differ from the SOTA, consider exploring a new direction.
  - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.

Note: Only factors with 'Factor Implementation' as True are implemented and tested in this experiment. If 'Factor Implementation' is False, the hypothesis for that factor cannot be verified in this run.

{
  "Observations": "The VWAP_10_Day_MA factor has shown improvements in several key metrics compared to the SOTA result. Specifically, the information ratio, annualized return, and IC have all improved, while the max drawdown has worsened slightly.",
  "Feedback for Hypothesis": "The hypothesis that a factor based on the 10-day moving average of the volume-weighted price (VWAP) could provide predictive power for future returns is supported by the results. The improvements in information ratio, annualized return, and IC indicate that this factor captures meaningful patterns in the data that contribute to better predictive power. However, the increase in max drawdown suggests that the factor might introduce additional risk during volatile periods.",
  "New Hypothesis": "A factor based on a combination of VWAP with other volume-based indicators, such as On-Balance Volume (OBV) or Money Flow Index (MFI), could further enhance predictive power while mitigating the risk associated with increased drawdowns.",
  "Reasoning": "The VWAP_10_Day_MA factor demonstrates potential in improving returns and predictive accuracy. However, the slight increase in max drawdown suggests that incorporating additional volume-based indicators, which account for buying and selling pressures, could help balance risk and reward. Exploring hybrid factors that combine VWAP with other volume-related metrics could lead to more robust results.",
  "Replace Best Result": "yes"
